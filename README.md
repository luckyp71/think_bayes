# Think Bayes

This repository provides code examples from the Think Bayes book, with several adjustments.<br/>
While the original author of Think Bayes used the empiricaldist library (developed by himself) for simulations, this implementation utilizes numpy, pandas and scipy to achieve equivalent results.<br/>
Most visualizations in this version are created using Plotly, whereas the original book used Matplotlib.
